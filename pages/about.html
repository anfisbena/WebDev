  <h1>Our Services</h1>
  <p>Waypoint is a US military contractor founded in 2010, specializing in husbandry services. Put simply, Waypoint assists the global transits and migrations of the US Navy and USCG billion-dollar warships. In addition to our logistical services, Waypoint coordinates life support for vessels in port and concierge services throughout the journey.
    All facets that feed into a vessels transit, everything that goes on, in, or around the ship as well as the parking spot is our wheelhouse. Our company aim is success and client satisfaction first. Blending into the background of daily functions to make each day as frictionless as possible and to identify issues before they happen. We advise on the best course forward that prevents delay or failures.
    Working as a military contractor for the last decade, Waypoint has comprised its institutional knowledge and expertise in one useable website now available to the public. It is our goal to provide the private yachter the same level of care and ease that Waypoint has crafted in our time working for the military. This website is our effort to remove all obstacles in the way of crafting your own adventure.

  <p>It was odd that in the private market yachters had such limitations, especially considering Waypoint’s current client simply announces where they are going and we make it happen.</p>
  <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
  <p>After years of contracting our services and facilitating vessel arrangements for the US Navy and US Coast Guard, we decided to avail ourselves to the private market. The idea came from trying to be a casual yachter ourselves. While arranging a charter seemed plain enough, creating a bespoke itinerary for international arrivals proved to be archaic. The options were pre-fabricated routes or a small pool of destinations from local agents. Neither allowed for spontaneity or client customization.
    It was odd that in the private market yachters had such limitations, especially considering Waypoint’s current client simply announces where they are going and we make it happen. Some of those times, our ‘make it happen’ can also include creating several small operational posts throughout a country. Frankly, booking last minute berths and services was always the easiest part.    
    Cue the lightbulb.
  </p>
  <h2>And so, we asked ourselves, "Why don't we fix this?"</h2>
  <p>So here we are. Automating our vendor rolodex, we have built this website to streamline the casual yachting industry with the wish to make it easier, more inclusive, and less stressful. Don’t get pigeonholed into a destination or route. Online, we are bringing this industry into the current millennia, while putting you in the captain’s seat.</p>
  <h2>Are we still military contractors?</h2>
  <p>Absolutely, and we grow in size with each passing year! We’re simply broadening our client base.</p>
